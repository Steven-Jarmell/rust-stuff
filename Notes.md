# Notes

## Introduction

Compile rust programs with `rustc {filename}`  

`rustc` generates a .exe file for the application, and a .pdb file with debugging information  

Rust is an **ahead of time** compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it without even having Rust installed  

Bigger projects in Rust use Cargo, which is Rust's build system and package manager  
- Handles tasks like building code, downloading and building dependencies
- Best for multiple files/dependencies

You can create a new project using Cargo using `cargo new {project name}`  
- Creates a new directory with a src directory and `Cargo.toml` file
    - TOML: Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language
- It also initializes a new Git repo with a `.gitignore` 

You build a cargo project with `cargo build`
- When you are ready to release you can add `--release` to the end to compile with optimizations
    
You run a cargo project with `cargo run`  
  
You can check code to make sure it compiles without producing an executable with `cargo check`  

## Programming a Guessing Game

By default, RUst has a set of items defined in the std lib called a prelude that it brings into the scope of every program  

Create a variable with `let {varname} = ...`.  

You can make a variable mutable with the mut keyword after 'let'  

One of Rust's major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use references.  

read_line() simultaneously puts the input into the string we pass, but it also returns a Result enumeration with `Ok` or `Err` indicating the operation was successful or failed.  

When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest version of everything the dependency needs from the **registry**, which is a copy of data from (Crates.io)["https://crates.io/"]  

WHen you build a project, Cargo creates a Cargo.lock file which it will know if it changes or not.  

When you do want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command `update`, which ignores the Cargo.lock file and figures out all the latest versions for packages in the Cargo.toml. 

`rand::thread_rng()` function gives us a particular random number generator we use, one that is local to the current thread of execution and is seeded by the OS

`std::cmp::Ordering` is another enum that has values of Less, Equal, and Greater which are the 3 outcomes possible when comparing two values.  

The `match` expression is used to decide what to do next based on which variant of Ordering was returned  

Rust has a strong static type system but also has type inference.
- i32 => 32 bit number, **default**
- u32 => unsigned 32 bit number
- i64 => 64 bit number
- Others

Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of guess with a new one, and Shadowing lets us reuse the variable name without forcing us to create two unique variables.  

## Common Programming Concepts  

### Variables and Mutability
  
By writing code in an immutable way you take advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers.

The Rust compiler guarantees that when you state a value won't change, it really won't change  

Constants, much like immutable variables, are bound to a name and cannot change
- You cannot use mut with constants. Constants aren't just immutable by default, they are immutable.
- The type of the value must be annotated.
- Example: `const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;`
- Naming convention is to use all uppercase with underscores in between words.

Shadowing is what we saw in the guessing game where we declared a new variable with the same name as a previous variable
- Different from making a variable as mut because we get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the let
- By creating a new variable when we use let keyword again, we can change the type as well, using the same name  
  
### Data Types

#### Scalar: Represents a single value
- Integers
- Floating Point
- Booleans
- Characters

8-bit	i8	u8
16-bit	i16	u16
32-bit	i32	u32
64-bit	i64	u64
128-bit	i128	u128
arch	isize	usize  

Uses two's complement
[2(2^(n-1)), ..., 2^(n-1) - 1]

You are allowed to write integer literals in Decimal, Hex, Octal, Binary, or Byte
- Number literals can use '_' as a visual separator like 98_222

**The primary situation in which you'd use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort of a collection**

Integer overflow
- An integer overflow will either result in panic or two's comple ent wrapping
- When compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow but when you compile in release mode, Rust does not check.

You can explicitly handle the possibility of overflow
- Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add.
- Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods.
- Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods.
- Saturate at the valueâ€™s minimum or maximum values with the saturating_* methods.

Since the default type is f64 on modern CPU's it is roughly the same speed as f32 but with more precision, so it is the default
- All floating types are signed.

Rust's `char` type is the language's most primitive alphabetic type
- 4 bytes in size and represents a unicode scalar value

**Compound** types can group multiple values into one type
- Rust has two primitive compound types: **tuples** and **arrays**
- Tuples:
    - Example: `let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`
    - Tuples can be destructured: `let (x, y, z) = tup;`
    - Tuples can be accessed by index. `let five_hundred = x.0;`
- Arrays:
    - Every element must be of the same type, unlike a tuple
    - In Rust, Arrays have a fixed length
    - Useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap or you want to ensure you have a fixed number of elements.
    - Vectors are a similar colelction type in the stdlib that are allowed to grow and shrink in size
    - Initializing Array
        - let a = [3; 5]; => [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
        - let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; (Specifies type and num of elements)
    - Arrays are bracket indexed
    - When you index an array, RUst checks that the index you specify is less than the array length, else it will panic
        - Prevents you from accessing invalid memory

### Functions
- Rust uses snake case as conventional style
- You must declare the type of each parameter
- Declaring type annotations in the function's definition means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code
- Function defitinitions are statements and do not return values thus you can't assign a let statement to another variable
- Statement: `let x = 3;`
- Expression: `let y = { let x = 3; x + 1};`
- Expressions do not include ending semicolons
- Functions with Return Values
    - We don't name return values but we must declare their type
    - `fn five() -> i32 { 5 }`

### Comments
- Often a comment is on a spearate line above the code its annotating

### Control Flow
- If, else/if, else blocks pretty similar to just normal java
    - You can use if in a let statement since its an expression
        - `let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };`
        - Types returned must be the same as each other, since variables must have a single type and cannot have joined types
- Loops
    - Three Kinds, `loop`, `while`, and `for`
    - If you have loops in loops, you can optionally add a loop label to explicitly break or continue a specified loop.
    - While loops are basic stuff
    - You can do `for element in a` to loop through a collection
    - If you do `for number in (1..4).rev()`, it will go backwards

## Understanding Ownership

### What is Ownership?

- Ownership is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory
- Memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks, and if any of the rules are violated, the program will not compile
- In a systems programming language like Rust, whether a value is on the stack or heap affects how the language behaves and causes you to make certain decisions
- Storing on the stack is faster than allocating on the heap b/c the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data
- Ownership addressed keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizes the amoutn of duplicate data on the heap, and cleans up unused data on the heap so you don't run out of space
- Every value in rust has one owner, and when the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
- The '::' allows you to access a namespace to avoid having to create funciton names like string_from, you can do String::from
- String literals are hardcoded into the final executable since we know the contents at compile time and it doesn't change.
- In order to support a growing piece of text (String mutable), we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap at runtime to hold the contents.
    - `let s = String::from("hello");` => String::from requests the memory
    - Since rust has no GC, the way it frees the memory it requests at runtime is that it frees the memory once the variable it owns goes out of scope.
    - When the variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a function called `drop`, which is where we put code to return the memory. Rust calls this function automatically at the closing curly bracket
- If you have a String literal, it's variable is added to the stack, but the actual String contents are in heap memory. 
    - If you make a second variable and set that equal to a string literal, it copies the pointer, length, and capacity which are on the stack and does not duplicate the heap contents because that would be expensive in runtime performance.
    - However, since we need to free the memory at that pointer when the variable goes out of scope, this could cause a panic. To solve this, after you set `s2 = s1`, that will invalidate s1 and will compile error if you try to use it. 
        - We say s1 `moved` to s2. It is no longer a shallow copy or deep copy
        - When s2 goes out of scope it alone will free the memory and s1 will not
        - Rust never automatically creates a deep copy of your data
    - If we do want to deep copy the heap data, we can use the `clone` method
        - Code is expensive
- Stack only data can copy automatically for integers
    - Types like integers have a known size at compile time and are entirely stored on the stacvk, so there's no reason we would want to prevent x from being valid after reassigning it.
- Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types stored in the stack. 
    - If a type implements `Copy`, variables that use it do not move and are trivially copied, thus valid to use
    - Rust will **not** let us annotate a type with `Copy` if it or any of its parts implement the `Drop` trait
        - `Drop` indicates that the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and thus adding `Copy` causes a compile-time error
        - ALl integer types, boolean types, floating point types, character types, and tuples (if they contain types that also implement `Copy`) have the `Copy` implementation
- When you pass a value to a function, it will move or copy just like it will durring assessment. (Anything with a Copy can still be used after reassigning its value)
- Ownership is so powerful because stuff like primitives, and anything you make a `Copy` trait for can all be pushed to the stack and its value reassigned while keeping the variable accessible, whereas if it was on the Heap with no `Copy`, or if it has a `Drop` trait implementation, if it is reassigned, the previous variable is no longer able to be used
- It is annoying that anything we pass into a funciton needs to be passed back if we want to use it again, but Rust allows us to return multiple values using a tuple.
- However, Rust lets you use a value without transferring ownership, called **references**

### References and Borrowing

If we provide a reference (pointer to an address), rather than the variable, we can access the data

`let len = calculate_length(&s1);`
- Creates a reference that refers to the value of s1 but does not own s1. Thus, the value it points to will not be dropped when its reference is no longer used

The action of creating a reference is called `Borrowing`

Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We cannot modify something we have a reference to.

**DOES NOT WORK:**
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

We can create mutable references:

**DOES WORK:**
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

Mutable References have one big restriction, that if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have NO OTHER REFERENCES to that value.

By preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time allows for very controlled mutation. 
- Prevents data races at compile time
- Data races are similar to race conditions and cause undefined behavior.

Way around it:

let mut s = String::from("hello");

{
    let r1 = &mut s;
} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

let r2 = &mut s;  

**Cannot combine mutable and immutable references**

Multiple immutable references are cool because no on ewho is reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else's reading of the data

In languages with pointers it's easy to create dangling pointers (a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else). However, Rust's compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references

Dangling Pointer Example:

fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
// Danger!  

When dangle is finished executing, s is deallocated due to `Drop`, thus this method would return a pointer to an address that was deallocated. Rust's compiler will throw an error if it recognizes this.

This is the solution:

fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s
}

Directly return the string, rather than a reference to it is best here.

### The Slice Type

Rust has string slices, which are references to a part of a string

let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello = &s[0..5];
let world = &s[6..11];

Rust's '..' range syntax
- If you want to start at index 0, you can drop the value before, like `&s[..5]`
- [starting_index..ending_index]. Ending index is one more than the last position
- If you want to end at the end of the string, you can drop the value after, like `&s[5..]`
- If you want the whole string, you do &s[..]

When using slices, the compiler ensures that the references to the String remain valid, by not letting a mutable change if it is borrowed as immutable elsewhere.

If we have a string slice, we can pass that directly

In Rust you can take advantage of something called deref coercions, in which you define a method to take a slice instead of a reference which can make APIs more generalizable.

There's a general slice type you can also use for arrays
